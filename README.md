# How to Run the Scripts

The roject includes two scripts: `simple.php` and `oop.php`. Both scripts process a JSON input file and apply an offset to notes. Below are instructions for running each script.

## Running scripts

### 1. **Simple script**

To run the simple implementation:

```bash
php simple.php in.json -6
```

-   **`simple.php`**: The script to execute.
-   **`in.json`**: Path to the input file containing notes in JSON format.
-   **`-6`**: The offset to apply to the notes.

### 2. **OOP script**

To run the object-oriented implementation:

```bash
php oop.php in.json -6
```

-   **`oop.php`**: The object-oriented version of the script.
-   **`in.json`**: Path to the input file containing notes in JSON format.
-   **`-6`**: The offset to apply to the notes.
